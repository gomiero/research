# 🧩 Matrix Ortho Operator (Experimental)

This repository contains an original implementation of a custom **orthogonal weighted matrix operator**, currently in active **research and experimental development**.

## 📐 Concept Overview

Given three square matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` of size `N x N`, this operator computes:

- `res1`: Standard matrix multiplication `a × b`, weighted by `c` **row-wise**.
- `res2`: The same multiplication, weighted by `c` **column-wise** (i.e., using `c.T`).
- `res`: A **2N x 2N** extended matrix combining `res1` and `res2` in an orthogonal layout.

This formulation allows `c` to act as a spatial or contextual modifier, introducing orthogonal “interference” or structural weight during matrix multiplication.

## 🎯 Purpose & Potential Applications

This operator is part of an **ongoing exploratory study** and may have potential applications in fields such as:

- 🔢 Experimental statistics and weighted transformations
- 🧪 Spatial and tensor-based physical simulations
- 🧠 Neural network architecture exploration (e.g., non-linear gates, perturbations)
- 🔬 Research on high-dimensional state distortions
- 🚀 Quantum computing models, custom logic gates, or statefield-based algorithms

*Note: All applications are theoretical and under conceptual investigation.*

## ⚗️ Research Status

This project is **not production-ready**.
It is a sandbox for testing mathematical structures and hybrid operators.
