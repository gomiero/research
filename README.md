# 🔄 Iterative Probabilistic Matrix Operator (Experimental)  
This repository introduces an original, experimental matrix expansion operator, designed for dynamic transformation of 2×2 probability matrices into structured 4×4 stochastic systems. The process mimics probabilistic growth, interaction between states, and evolving spatial structures.

## 🧠 Concept Overview  
The system is composed of two core functions:

o_boot: Takes a 2×2 matrix a and embeds it into a 4×4 matrix, expanding its values via nonlinear cross-multiplications that simulate state interactions across the matrix boundaries.

o_iter: Applies blockwise cross-multiplications between submatrices of the 4×4 result and reconstructs a new 4×4 matrix. This process is normalized after each iteration, transforming the system into a stochastic state transition matrix.

Each iteration modifies the internal probabilistic structure, potentially revealing convergence, symmetry, entropy shifts, or spatial dynamics over time.

## 🧪 Purpose & Potential Applications

This operator is part of an ongoing research project, with potential experimental applications such as:

- 🎲 Iterative stochastic simulations (inspired by Markov processes)
- 🧬 Fractal matrix dynamics and self-similarity structures
- 📊 Experimental statistical modeling and entropy propagation
- 🧠 AI-inspired state evolution, alternative decision fields, or transition maps
- 🛰️ Simulation of evolving probability fields in constrained state spaces

# 🧩 Matrix Ortho Operator (Experimental)

This repository contains an original implementation of a custom **orthogonal weighted matrix operator**, currently in active **research and experimental development**.

## 📐 Concept Overview

Given three square matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` of size `N x N`, this operator computes:

- `res1`: Standard matrix multiplication `a × b`, weighted by `c` **row-wise**.
- `res2`: The same multiplication, weighted by `c` **column-wise** (i.e., using `c.T`).
- `res`: A **2N x 2N** extended matrix combining `res1` and `res2` in an orthogonal layout.

This formulation allows `c` to act as a spatial or contextual modifier, introducing orthogonal “interference” or structural weight during matrix multiplication.

## 🎯 Purpose & Potential Applications

This operator is part of an **ongoing exploratory study** and may have potential applications in fields such as:

- 🔢 Experimental statistics and weighted transformations
- 🧪 Spatial and tensor-based physical simulations
- 🧠 Neural network architecture exploration (e.g., non-linear gates, perturbations)
- 🔬 Research on high-dimensional state distortions
- 🚀 Quantum computing models, custom logic gates, or statefield-based algorithms

*Note: All applications are theoretical and under conceptual investigation.*
